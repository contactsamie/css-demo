# First CSS Stylesheets

## Inline Styles
	
	You may use inline styles with just about any HTML element.

	Because of the inconvenience of inline styles and difficulty of maintenance of the document, in general, inline styles are often not optimal for production.

	The one exception for usage of inline styles is in the production of HTML5 emails. When producing HTML5 emails, you almost always have to use inline styles.

## Styles in the document head

## Attaching an external stylesheet with link
		
	Note that the style tags are not used in an external document
		
# Styling Text

## Color
	
	Named Colors
		
		Named colors actually have its drawbacks. For example, can you visualize the difference between Gold and GoldenRod?
	
	RGB Colors
	
		RGB (Red-Blue-Green) are colors produced by mixing various intensities of the colors of red, blue and green. 
		This is similar to how many monitors work by mixing red, blue and green light in various intensities at each pixel.

	
	Hexadecimal Colors
	
		 Instead of representing these values with the numbers 0-255, the hexadecimal number system is used with a range from 0-FF.


## Text Alignment
	
	left, center, right, and justify
	
	
## Text Transform

	capitalize, uppercase, and lowercase
	
	
## Text Decoration

	underline and overline


## Spacing Text

	text-indent
	
	letter-spacing
	
	line-height
	
	word-spacing (don't adjust it)
	
	
## Text Shadow

	The text-shadow rule allows you to place a drop shadow effect behind the text
	
	The text-shadow rule has three components. The first is the horizontal offset of the shadow. The second component is the vertical offset of the shadow, and the third is the color of the shadow expressed as a named, RGB or hex color.
